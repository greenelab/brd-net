Transfer learning for uncovering the biology underlying rare disease

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ben-heil/brd-net.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ben-heil/brd-net)

The goal of this project is to 
1. train a model to differentiate between the gene expression of healthy individuals and individuals with a disease
2. apply the model to rare diseases and find how gene expression differs in the disease state
